# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

    ContactForm.js       - Contains the contact form for users to send inquiries
  /pages
    HomePage.js          - Main landing page that combines all the sections
  /styles
    styles.css           - Contains global styles and media queries for responsiveness
  App.js                 - The root component that renders the home page and overall layout
  index.js               - The entry point that renders the App component to the DOM


### Technologies Used

   . React: Used to build the UI components and manage the application state.
   . CSS: The styling for the website is done using traditional CSS for simplicity and ease of implementation.
   . React Router: Not yet included in this code but could be added for routing between different sections or pages if needed.
   . Font Awesome: For adding icons.
   . Form Validation: For handling the validation of the contact form.
   . CSS Media Queries: Used to ensure that the layout is responsive for various devices mobile and tablet.


###  Project Features


   . Responsive Layout: The design adapts to mobile and tablet views using CSS media queries.
   . Footer Section: a simple paragraph.
   . Hero Section: A large, welcoming section with a call-to-action button.
   . Service Section: Displays the various services offered by the business.
   . Testimonial Slider: A carousel displaying feedback from customers.
   . Contact Form: A simple contact form where users can send inquiries.


### Setup & Installation


  ## Prerequisites
    Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
       . Node.js (Recommended version: 14 or above)
       . npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)


### Steps to Run the Project Locally

   1. Clone the Repository

      First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

          git clone https://github.com/SunnySaiPavan/BPOServices.git
          
   2. Install Dependencies

       Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

          npm install
          This will install all necessary packages defined in the package.json file.

   3. Run the Project Locally
       Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

       npm start
       This will start the application, and you can open it in your browser by navigating to:
       http://localhost:3000
       The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.

   4. Build the Project for Production

       If you want to build the project for production (to deploy to a live server), use:

       npm run build
       This will create an optimized build in the build/ directory.

### How the Project Works


  .  The App.js component is the root of the application. It imports and renders the HomePage.js component, which combines all the sections.
  .  Each section (header, footer, hero, services, testimonials, and contact form) is modularized into its own React component located in the /components directory.
  .  The styles.css file contains all the global styles, including CSS media queries for responsive design.
  .  The TestimonialSlider.js component uses Swiper to create a carousel of customer testimonials.
